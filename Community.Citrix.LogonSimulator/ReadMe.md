## What is the Citrix Logon Simulator MP?

It's a Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) management pack for simulating logons to Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop via NetScaler and StoreFront. You will need SCOM to use the management pack.

Once installed and configured, the management pack will perform regular, automated application launches in your Citrix environment to enure your applications are available to end users. Using SCOM, you can configure email notifications for any failures, build dashboards to show real-time availability, and create management reports to demonstrate Citrix uptime and availability.
