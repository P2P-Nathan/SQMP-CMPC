Community based Management Pack for Hyper-V 2012 R2 to overcome the limitations of the standard ones. Importing this MP disables the VM monitoring delivered by the Microsoft authored Hyper-V Management Pack.

Check for latest commits on hitgub <https://github.com/brandubh/HypervMP> 

Current Version: 1.1.0.72 - 14/01/2017 

Added VM Tasks.

Some features of the MP.

-          Comprehensive discovery with at least the same information you can get from the VMM integration, some properties discovered

-   OS and platform
-   Farm (very useful to create dashboards and groups)
-   Hardware configuration
-   Connected VHD(x)
-   Connected NICs

-          An optimized discovery that is triggered when VMs are moved, started or stopped

-          A complete replica monitoring scenario with diagnostics, recoveries (disabled by default) and tasks to resume replica

-          A couple of monitor related to GPUs and remoteFX inherited from the MS provided MP, disabled by default since I consider them not useful. But in any case I didn't want to lose monitoring capabilities.

-          Integration services obsolescence (only for Windows VMs since I don't know how to update *nix VMs now that MS isn't releasing anymore IS for platforms that have the services included in the kernel)

-          VHD(x) fragmentation level monitoring, this one can be noisy, but if you have fragmented VHDs you better know it, since the performance impact can be significant

-          VM uptime in % in the observation period (as you wish @Stas), this can useful to bill on uptime

-          VM measures as performance counters for enabled virtual machines (Enable-VMMeasure)
